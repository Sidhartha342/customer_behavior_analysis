📊 Customer Behavior Data Analytics Project
Overview
This project demonstrates a complete end-to-end data analytics workflow, starting from raw data ingestion to business-ready insights.
The analysis focuses on understanding customer purchase behavior, identifying key patterns, and presenting insights through SQL analysis, Power BI dashboards, and a professional presentation built using Gamma.
The goal is not just analysis, but clear communication of insights for decision-making.
